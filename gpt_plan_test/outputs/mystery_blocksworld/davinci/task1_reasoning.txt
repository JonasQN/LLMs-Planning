I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

   Attack object
   Feast object from another object
   Succumb object
   Overcome object from another object

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    To perform Attack action, the following facts need to be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be true: Pain object.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be false: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    To perform Succumb action, the following facts need to be true: Pain object.
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.    
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be false: Pain object.
    To perform Overcome action, the following needs to be true: Province other object, Pain object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be true: Harmony, Pain object, Object Craves other object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be false: Province other object, Pain object.
    To perform Feast action, the following needs to be true: Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be true: Pain object, Province other object.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be false:, Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, province object a, province object b, province object d, harmony, object b craves object c, planet object a, planet object c and planet object d.
My goal is to have that object c craves object b.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
feast object b from object c
succumb object b
attack object c
overcome object c from object b
[PLAN END]

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, province object a, province object d, harmony, object a craves object b, object d craves object c, planet object b and planet object c.
My goal is to have that object c craves object a.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
--------- GPT3 response ---------
attack object a
succumb object a
feast object c from object a
overcome object a from object c
[PLAN END]

(pick-up object a)
(put-down object a)
(unstack object c object a)
(stack object a object c)

-------- Ground truth plan ---------
(unstack object d object c)
(put-down object d)
(pick-up object c)
(stack object c object a)
