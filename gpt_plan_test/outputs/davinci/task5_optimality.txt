I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do: 
Pick up a block. It takes 1 minute to pick up a block.
Unstack a block from on top of another block. It takes 1 minute to unstack a block from on top of another block. 
Stack a block on top of another block. It takes 1 minute to stack a block on top of another block.
I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.
