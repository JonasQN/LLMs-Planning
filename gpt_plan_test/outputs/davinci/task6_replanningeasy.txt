I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that the white block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on the table, the red block is on the table, the hand is empty, the white block is clear, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on the table, the red block is clear and the orange block is clear
My goal is to have that the yellow block is on top of the red block, the red block is on top of the white block and the orange block is on top of the blue block.
My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the white block from on top of the blue block
put down the white block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the white block
unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block
stack the orange block on top of the blue block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the red block

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that the yellow block is on the table, the white block is on the table, the hand is currently holding yellow block, the red block is on top of the white block, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on the table, the red block is clear and the orange block is clear
