I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do 

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and there are no other blocks on top of it.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking had no other block on top of it.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block has no other blocks on top of it.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that the hand is empty, the black block is on the table, the red block is on the table, the cyan block is on the table, the silver block is on the table, the black block is clear, the red block is clear, the cyan block is clear and the silver block is clear
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the black block, the black block is on top of the cyan block and the cyan block is on top of the silver block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
pick up the cyan block
stack the cyan block on top of the silver block
pick up the black block
stack the black block on top of the cyan block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the black block

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that the hand is empty, the blue block is on the table, the cyan block is on the table, the orange block is on the table, the yellow block is on the table, the silver block is on the table, the magenta block is on the table, the blue block is clear, the cyan block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the silver block is clear and the magenta block is clear
My goal is to have that the silver block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the cyan block, the cyan block is on top of the magenta block and the magenta block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:
