I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions.
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can pick up or unstack a block only if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
I can only put down a block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I had previously picked up or unstacked the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
